    "defaultMessage": "Rent a cottage in true Smolandian farm environment. This summerhouse/cottage has what many seek. The cottage is also winterized and can be rented all year round.\n\nCalm, close to the sea (50 meters) and with access to boat, canoe and bikes. Here you can fish, go for wonderful strolls in the forest and on dirt roads.\n\nHere is a rich fauna of flowers and plants, this is because the area has been cultivated in small-scale with grazing animals for generations. The area also has a very rich birdlife.\n\nFor those interested in trips there is a wide range of options. With its location right in the middle of Småland there is an array of trip destinations within a short drive.\n\nClose to Korrö recreation ground (4 km), opportunities for many fun activities open up, see link below. Please also see the other links available for tips on things to do."
